We currently use a Rate Table to determine shipping costs according to Weight (KGs) and Postcode.  Refer attached file.  We would like to convert this into a simple "Look Up" function using Excel / Google Sheets so that our staff can simply enter the Weight and Postcode to calculate the correct Shipping Cost.  Ideally we will run this on Google Sheets so that it can be easily shared by staff.
